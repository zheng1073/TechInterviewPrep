Write an algorithm to determine the minimum distance required for the truck to deliver the order.

Delivery area represented as a two-dimensional grid of integers, where each integer represents one cell. 

1 - Accessible areas
0 - Areas' without road
9 - Destination

[[1 0 0]
 [1 0 0]
 [1 9 0]]

Input: Area (2D grid of integers)
Output: Return integer representing the total diistance traveled or return -1.
