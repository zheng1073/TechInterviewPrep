## Types of variables
- Local Variable:
  - Variables defined within a block or method. variables inside a constructor can be a local variable
  - Created when the function is called and destoryed when the call returns from the function
- Instance Variable
  - Non-static variables declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block
  - Created when an object of the class is created and destoryed when the object is destoryed
  - Can use access specifiers for instance variables
- Static Variable 
  - Aka Class Variables
  - Similar to instance variables except they are declared with a Static keyword.
  - Only one static variable per class (not per object)
  - Created at the start of a program and destroyed when executation ends.  

## Access Specifiers 
Methods and data members of a class / interface can have one of the four access specifies: (in order of restrictiveness):
1. Private --> accessible within the class where defined
2. Defaut or package private
3. Protected
4. Public --> accessible from any class

Classes and interfaces themselves  have 2 access specifiers when declared outside any other classs
1. Public
2. Default

If you are applying to backend/Java focused positions, make sure you study the OOP concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interface), Spring/Spring boot and microservices if you had prior experience.

If you are applying to Fullstack/Frontend positions, make sure you understand the Javascript fundamentals (arrow functions, ES6/ES7, JSON objects, promises/async await, CSS styling, CORS, React/Redux).
